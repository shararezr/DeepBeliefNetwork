In this project, we explore computational models of visual concept learning. The main objective of the project is to investigate the ability of the model to learn and represent visual concepts. The project is based on the Python code presented during the Lab practices. we perform different analyses to explore the behavior of the model and its internal representations.

we will use a Deep belief network(DBN) once with fine-tuning and once without fine-tuning, and then compare the results with the CNN and FNN models. Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are both powerful models used in machine learning for various tasks including image classification, object detection, and data denoising.

DBNs are a class of neural networks that use multiple layers of hidden units to learn hierarchical representations of the input data. Each layer is trained to model the probability distribution of its inputs given the outputs of the previous layer. DBNs are good at learning complex representations of the data, and can be used for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. They have been successfully applied to a wide range of applications, such as speech recognition, image classification, and natural language processing.

CNNs, on the other hand, are a class of neural networks designed specifically for processing images. They are composed of several layers that perform feature extraction and transformation of the input image. The first layers typically perform simple local operations like edge detection, while the later layers learn more abstract features. CNNs have been shown to perform well on image classification tasks, and have been applied in various domains such as medical imaging and object detection.
